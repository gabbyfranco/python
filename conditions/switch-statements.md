# Switch Statements

On some occasions you will have to test a variable against many conditions to deal with.

You can use a **_match case statement_** as an alternative to an if statement.

With the if statement, you would have to write the if condition, all the alternative if else conditions and finally an else condition. 

A **_match statement_** compares a value to several different conditions until one is met.
