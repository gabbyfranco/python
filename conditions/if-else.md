# If & else If

## **_Control Flow_**

    - refers to the order in which the instructions in a program are executed. 

There are 2 types of control flows in Python.

1. Conditional:

     - if
        - if the condition proves to be true, a function is performed.
     - else
        - catches anything that isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
     - elif(else if)
        - Python's way of saying if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition.

2. Loops

    - for loop
        - checks for specific conditions and repeatedly executes a block of code as long as those conditions are met.
    - while loop
        - repeats a specific block of code an unknown number of times until a condition is met.
