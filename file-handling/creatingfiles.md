# Creating Files in Python

Files are used to permanently stored data. Anything stored in the variables of your code exists in ***random access memory*** or ***RAM***. Since ***RAM*** loses its data when the computer is turned off, it's important to be able to create files, so data is available  future use or as a permanent record.
