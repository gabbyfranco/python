# Strings in Python

### *A string is a sequence of characters in single or double quotes*

+ computers only understand binary- ones and zeros.
+ the characters need to be converted to a form that the computers can interpret.

#### examples: 

    1. 'We are open'
    2. "24 hours a day!"


## Single Line

    *ex. varA = "Hello World"*

## Reassigning a String Value

#name variable is assigned with the value of John
i.e -
    name = 'John'
    print(name)
    *John*
    #name is reassigned the value of Paul
    print(name)
    name = 'Paul'
