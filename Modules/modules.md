# What are Modules in Python ?

*__Modules__* are building blocks for adding *__functionality__* to your code.

A *__Python module__* contains *__statements__* and  *__definitions__*.

Modules in Python can contain both *__executable statements__* and *__functions__*.

*__Modules__* come from modular programming. This means that the *__functionality of code__* is broken down into parts or *__blocks of code__*.

These parts or blocks have great advantages which are:

+ *__Scope__*
+ *__Reusability__*
+ *__Simplicity__*

Everything in Python is an object, so the names that you use for functions, variables, and so on become important.

*__Scoping__* means that modules create a separate namespace.
- 2 different module have functions with the same name, and importing a module makes this a part of the global space in the code being executed.

*__Reusability__* the most important advantage of modularity. When you write a piece of code, *__modules__* help you avoid the need to  write all the functionalities that you may need.


# Accessing Modules

You can access different types of modules,such as *__built-in modules__* and *__user-defined modules__* from different locations.

*__Remember that any Python file can be a module.__*
 
The modules are searched by *__the interpreter__* and the following sequence.

1. *__Current Directory Path__*

2. *__The Built-In Module Directory__*

3. *__The Python Path__* (environment variable with a list of directories)

4. *__It investigates the installation dependent default directory__*
