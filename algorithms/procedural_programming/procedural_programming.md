# Procedural Programming

Developers can sturcture their code in many different ways.
Python allows for object oriented, procedural, and functional programming models, or as they're often called paradigms.

***Procedural Programming*** is like writing step-by-step instructions. It's an important step to object oriented programming.

The main purpose of a programming model is to structure your code. That structure makes it easier to update the code and create new functionality within the code. 

There's no perfect model that's a solution to coding structures,and sometimes a combination of approaches works best.

***Procedural Programming*** structures code into procedures, sometimes called subroutines or functional sections of code. Because of this approach, the code is made up of logical steps to complete a specific task.

*_For Example:_*

adding 2 numbers to return their sum.

*a = 5*
*b = 10*
*sum1 = a + b*

*c = 8*
*d = 4*
*sum2 = c + d*

*print(sum1)*
*print(sum2)*

In programming, there is a principle called ***DRY***.

*__D__*on't
*__R__*epeat
*__Y__*ourself

It's all about reducing duplication in code.

A guideline to keep in mind is to **_create functions that can be used_** throughtout your application.
