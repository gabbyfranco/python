## **_What are functions?_**

You can think of functions as a set of instructions that take an input and return outputs.

For example, the primary task of the print function is to print a value.

1. Declare functions in Python

A function is declared using the ***def*** keyword followed by the name and task to complete.

*def <function name>:*
    *<task to complete>*

*__Optional parameters__* can also be added after the function name within a pair of parentheses.

*def <function name>(<params>):*
    *<task to complete>*

2. Pass data in functions
3. Return data from functions
