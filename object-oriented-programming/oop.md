# Object Oriented Programming 

Programmung languages are built upon certain models to ensure the code behaves predictably.

***Object Oriented*** or *__O.O.P__* relies heavily on simplicity and reusability to improve workflow.

Programming paradigms are a strategy for reducing code complexity and determining the flow of execution.

There are several different paradigms such as *__decarative__*, *__procedural__*, _**object-oriented**_, *__function__*,*__logic__*, _**event-driven**_, *__flow-driven more__*.

Python is primarily *__object-oriented__*, but it's also *__procedural__* and *__functional__*.

In simple terms, a paradigm can be defined as a style of writing a program.

OOP is one of the most widely used paradigms today ue to growing popularity of languages that use it, such as *__Java__*, *__Python__*, *__C++__*, and more!

The OOP's ability to translate real-world problems into code is arguably the biggest factor in its success.

OOP has high *__modularity__* which makes the code easier to understand, makes it reusable, adds layers of abstraction, and allows code blocks to be moved between projects.

OOP's key components:

+ *__Classes__*
    
    + A *__class__* is a logical code block that contains *__attributes__* and *__behaviors__*.

    + In Python, a class is defiened with the class keyword.

    + *__Attributes__* can be *__variables__*.

    + The *__behavior__* can be functions inside of it. 

    You can create instances from these classes which are called *__objects__*.

    + a class provides a blueprint for creating an object.

+ *__Objects__*

    + An *__object__* is an instance of a class and you can create any number of them.

    + The state of an object comprises its *__attributes__* and *__behavior__* and each one has a unique identifier to distinguish it from other instances.

    + The *__attributes__* and *__behavior__* of the class are what define the state of the object.

+ *__Methods__*

    + *__Methods__* are functions defined inside a class that determine the behavior of an object instance.

The next concept is called *__polymorphism__*, it means having many forms. 

*__Polymorphism__* means that a single function can act differently depending on the object or the causes.

The third concept is *__encapsulation__*.

*__Encapsulation__* means that Python can bind methods and variable from direct access by wrapping them within a single unit of scope, such as a class.
