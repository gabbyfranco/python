# Python classes and instances

*__Classes__* have the ability to combine data and functionality, which is a very useful feature when you are coding.

*__Attributes__* are referred to variables declared in a class.

*__Behaviors__* are associated with the methods in the class.

Creating a class creates a new type of object from which you can create *__instances__*.

An important thing to keep in mind is that everything in Python is an object or derived from the object class.
