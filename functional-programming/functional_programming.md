# Functional Programming

## What is Functional Programming?

***Functional Programming*** uses a different paradigm than other models, such as object oriented.
It's particularly adept at processing large amounts of data at high speeds.

 
Functions take some input, processes it and then produces some outputs.

There are two types of functions traditional and pure.  

***Pure Functions*** will always do the same thing and return the same results no matter how many times they are called.

There are several differences between traditional and pure, so let's list them.

***Traditional Functions*** can access and modify variables on the global state, but ***pure functions*** cannot, both ***traditional functions*** and ***pure functions*** can access variables in the local state.

***Traditional Functions*** can change args, whereas pure functions cannot, and lastly, the outputs of ***traditional functions*** does not depend on inputs. However, the output of ***pure functions*** does depend on input.

***Functional Programming*** in essence is a programming paradigm that utilizes functions for clean, consistent and maintainable code.

Compared to ***object orientated programming***, ***functional programming*** differs by design.

***Functional programming*** does not change the data outside the scope of the function. This simply means that the function should avoid modifying the input data or arguments being passed, instead it should only return the completed result of the intended function being called.

Functions are considered ***standalone*** or *****independent*** and this aids the clean and elegant nature of the code.
