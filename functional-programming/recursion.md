# Recursions

***Recursions*** are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It's especillay good for working on things that have many possible branches and too complex for an iterative approach

***Recursion*** is essentially a function that calls itself. It creates a pattern of repeating itself over and over.
