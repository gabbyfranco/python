# Pure Functions

It's imporant to understand that there is a difference between **_traditional_** and **_pure_** functions.

A **_Pure Function_** is a function that does not change any effect on a variable, data, list, or sets beyond its own scope.

For example, if you have a list with the global scope, a ***pure function*** cannot add something to that list or alter it in any way.
